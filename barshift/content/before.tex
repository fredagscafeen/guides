\section{Before the bar shift}
\label{sec:pre-bar-shift}

We meet at 2:30 PM at the gate. The gate is by the spiral staircase down to the Nygaard basement.

The bar opens at 3:00 PM, and it is important
that we DO NOT sell alcohol before then, as that is where we have our alcohol license.

Before the bar shift, the bar must be set up with everything that entails. Here
it is sorted by where things need to be picked up/things need to be arranged.

During the bar shift, you as a bartender have access to a \textit{bar key}\index{bar key}.
This key is in the bar and can unlock \textit{Behind the Bars}\index{Behind the Bars},
\textit{The Room Under the Stairs}\index{The Room Under the Stairs},
\textit{The Cleaning Room}\index{The Cleaning Room} opposite the disabled toilets in Nygaard -1,
\textit{The Wooden Cage}\index{The Wooden Cage} in Hopper -1
and the warehouse in \textit{The Parking Garage}\index{The Parking Garage}.

The bar normally closes at 22:00, but can in some cases close earlier if there are less
than customers, where $n \le$ few.
However, at parties or the like, we may close later, this will be announced in advance and there will
be several teams of bartenders assigned to such a shift.

\subsection{Behind the Bars}
\label{sec:pre:behind-the-bars}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The bar must be driven to the bar area with a \textit{drip bucket}\index{Drip bucket}.
	\item The \textit{refrigerators}\index{Refrigerators} must be full, and driven to each side of the refrigerators in the
	\textit{Bar area}\index{Bar area}. Be careful when driving the refrigerators, as they are not secured to the wheels,
	and they can fall forward if pushed too hard and too high. See \autoref{fig:refrigerator-rip}. In addition,
	you must be careful not to run into anything on the road. Should any of the contents spill out of the door, you can put a jacket
	under it and carefully open it while grabbing bottles between the doors.
	\item The ``pant'' box is collected.
	\item If it's the first Friday of the month, also bring out the wheel of fortune.
\end{itemize}

The bar area is typically set up in Nygaard-K02, as seen in \autoref{fig:bar-area}.

		\item Specialty beer is connected to the center-right tap.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Cleaning Room}
\label{sec:pre:cleaning-room}

\begin{itemize}
	\item From the cleaning room, you can get a bucket of soapy water and a cloth.
	\item In addition, there is a key on top of the paper dispenser. This can be used to
	open the paper roll, and you can get a roll ``\textit{Spæns}\index{Spæns}''
	from one of the open toilets if there is no roll in the bar.
	Remember to remove the blue piece of plastic at the end.
\end{itemize}

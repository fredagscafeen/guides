A bar plan is created at regular intervals, which can be viewed at
\url{https://fredagscafeen.dk/barplan/}. In addition, you can also get an
iCalendar (.ics) file with your bar shifts at
\url{https://fredagscafeen.dk/barplan/shifts/<yourUsernameHere>.ics}.

The format is four names, for example ``housa + brinck +
gittep + jens3694''. Here, the bartenders \emph{housa},
\emph{brinck}, \emph{gittep} and \emph{jens3694} are bartenders, and
since \emph{housa} is the first on the list, she is the one responsible for
this day.

Only bartenders at the \emph{water truck}\index{Water truck} are set as
responsible for a shift. The van is for board members
and other ``experienced'' bartenders. As the name suggests, it implies
among other things, that you must have a blood alcohol content of less than $0.5$.

If you have been given a shift at a time that you cannot, you can try
to get it swapped. Start by freeing up the shift on the bar schedule,
and then send an email to \allemail and
ask if there is anyone who can take it, or would like to swap.

% If someone else can't do a certain bar shift, and you haven't had
% your first shift yet, or you don't have any more shifts left on the
% shift schedule, it's not a problem for you to take it over: The person you
% swap with can just take over one of your shifts on the next bar schedule.
